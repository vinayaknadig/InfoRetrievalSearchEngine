# InfoRetrievalSearchEngine
Implementing a simple implementation of a search engine using a large set of urls.

If you wish to re-index the set of urls provided, you must run the file indexer.py. However, in this folder the DEV folder of all the json files is not present. Download the data-set into this folder before proceeding with indexing.

If you just wish to search, please run the searcher.py file and follow the prompt to complete a query. Only a maximum of the top 200 results will be shown.
